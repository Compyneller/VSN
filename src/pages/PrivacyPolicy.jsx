            </h5>
            <p>
              You have several rights under data protection laws about the way
              we process your personal data. These are set out below. You may
              contact us using the details in section 14 below to exercise any
              of these rights. We will respond to any request received from you
              within one month from the date of the request. Description of the
              rights:
              <br />
              <br />
              1-A right to access personal data held by us about you. <br />
              <br />
              2-A is right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data
              held by us about you. <br />
              <br />
              3-A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about
              you. This right will only apply where (for example): we no longer
              need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected
              it for; where you withdraw your consent (if we are using your data
              based on your consent); or where you object to the way we process
              your data (in line with Right 6 below). <br />
              <br />
              4-A right to restrict our processing of personal data held by us
              about you. This right will only apply where (for example): you
              dispute the accuracy of the personal data held by us; where you
              would have the right to require us to erase the personal data but
              would prefer that our processing is restricted instead; or where
              we no longer need to use the personal data to achieve the purpose
              we collected it for, but you require the data for dealing with
              legal claims. <br />
              <br />
              5-A right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us,
              in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You
              also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data
              to another organization, at your request. <br />
              <br />
              6-A right to object to our processing of your data (including
              sending promotional messages to you). <br />
              <br />
              7-A right to withdraw your consent, where we are relying on it to
              use your data (for example, to provide you with promotional
              messages about our services or products). If you withdraw your
              consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or
              services to you. <br />
              <br />
              These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the
              public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and
              our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege).
